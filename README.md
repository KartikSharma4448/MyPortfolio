Full-Stack Dynamic Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio website, live at kartiksharma.site.
This is not just a static site. It is a full-stack monorepo application featuring a React frontend, a Node.js (Hono/Express) backend API, a PostgreSQL database, and a complete, secure Admin Panel for dynamic content management.

üöÄ About This Project
The primary goal of this project was to build a high-performance, fully dynamic portfolio that I could manage without touching the code.
All content‚Äîincluding projects, blog posts, skills, and certificates‚Äîis served from a database. I built a secure Admin Panel with authentication where I can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all site content.
